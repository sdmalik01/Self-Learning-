# Basics syntax and things around python: such as variables, user inputs, loops, conditional statements, etc. 
# Variables:
number = 21
string = "Malik"
floatNumber = 26.58
#To check the data type of the variable 
print(type(number)) #Output: <class 'int'>

#To assign multiple values:
x, y, z = 21, "malik", 25.89
'''Here x = 21, y = Malik, z = 25.89'''

# Data type casting: refers to changing the data type of the variable
x = 21
print(type(string(x)))
